Student teams will work with preliminary data to define the problem. They will then collect and analyze interview and survey data from potential users and begin to design a solution. Students will explore how to use novel monitoring technologies and \u201cbig data\u201d for  product improvement and evaluation. The student teams will use the case studies (with improvements based on  user feedback and data analysis) to develop a plan for  scaling and evaluation with a rigorous controlled trial.", "crossListed": ["MEC ENG C200"], "units": {"maximum": 3, "minimum": 3}, "fExam": {"code": "Y", "description": "Yes"}, "cN": "C200", "priComp": "LEC", "sections": [{"id": 38937, "number": "001", "graded": true, "assocPriSecId": 38937, "status": {"code": "O", "description": "Open"}, "type": "LEC", "enrollment": {"wMax": 15, "eCurr": 1, "eMin": 0, "wCurr": 0, "eMax": 10}, "isPri": true, "meetings": [{"dayAbbrevs": "Mo", "instructors": [{"role": "1-TIC", "name": "Ashok  Gadgil"}], "sT": "18:00:00", "days": {"Th": false, "We": false, "Tu": false, "Mo": true, "Su": false, "Fr": false, "Sa": false}, "loc": {}, "eT": "21:30:00"}]}], "sAC": "DEV ENG"}]}
